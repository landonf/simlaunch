/**
 * @page error_handling Error Handling Programming Guide
 *
 * Where a method may return an error, PLSimulator provides access to the underlying
 * cause via an optional PLSimulator argument.
 *
 * All returned errors will be a member of one of the below defined domains, however, new domains and
 * error codes may be added at any time. If you do not wish to report on the error cause, many methods
 * support a simple form that requires no NSError argument.
 *
 * @section Error Domains, Codes, and User Info
 *
 * @subsection plsimulator_errors Plausible Simulator Errors
 *
 * Any errors in Plausible Simulator use the #PLSimulatorErrorDomain error domain, and and one
 * of the error codes defined in #PLSimulatorError.
